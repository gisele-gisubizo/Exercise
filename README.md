# Node Express Product API

Hey there! Welcome to my Node Express Product API project. This is a simple and fun project I built to manage a list of products. You can create, view, update, and delete productsâ€”plus, you can even upload images for each product using Multer and Cloudinary. I hope you find it as enjoyable to use (and look at) as I did building it!

## What This Project Does
- **CRUD Operations:** Create, read, update, and delete products.
- **Image Uploads:** Easily add product images using Multer, which saves files locally, and then automatically uploads them to Cloudinary.
- **Database Powered by MongoDB:** All product data is stored in MongoDB via Mongoose.
- **Environment Configurable:** Use a `.env` file to manage your settings, so you can keep your secrets safe.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine.
- A [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) account (or another MongoDB setup).
- A [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) account for handling image uploads.
